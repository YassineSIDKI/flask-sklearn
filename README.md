# Continuous delivery project of a maching learning application using azure, flask and sklearn

## Introduction

In this project, you will focus on creating a continuous delivery cycle with azure pipelines, using a given code for maching learning application (that you will not develop yourself) which will be hosted in github, and azure portal to create environement on which your application will be deployed.

## Project Plan

We use for planning trello to track tasks as tickets and spreadsheet with weekly planning per year

- A link to a Trello board for the project
- A link to a spreadsheet that includes the original and final project plan>

## Instructions

#### Setup environment

Clone this repository:

- git clone ::

<TODO: Instructions for running the Python project. How could a user with no context run this project without asking you for any help. Include screenshots with explicit steps to create that work. Be sure to at least include the following screenshots:

- Project running on Azure App Service

- Project cloned into Azure Cloud Shell

- Passing tests that are displayed after running the `make all` command from the `Makefile`

- Output of a test run

- Successful deploy of the project in Azure Pipelines. [Note the official documentation should be referred to and double checked as you setup CI/CD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/ecosystems/python-webapp?view=azure-devops).

- Running Azure App Service from Azure Pipelines automatic deployment

- Successful prediction from deployed flask app in Azure Cloud Shell. [Use this file as a template for the deployed prediction](https://github.com/udacity/nd082-Azure-Cloud-DevOps-Starter-Code/blob/master/C2-AgileDevelopmentwithAzure/project/starter_files/flask-sklearn/make_predict_azure_app.sh).
  The output should look similar to this:

```bash
udacity@Azure:~$ ./make_predict_azure_app.sh
Port: 443
{"prediction":[20.35373177134412]}
```

- Output of streamed log files from deployed application
